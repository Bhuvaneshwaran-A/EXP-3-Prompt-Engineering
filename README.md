### **📌 Case 3: Summarizing Renewable Energy Text**

**Prompt:**
*“Summarize the following passage into a short paragraph:
Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, are increasingly adopted to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. These energy systems are environmentally friendly, sustainable, and help in reducing carbon emissions. However, challenges remain in terms of energy storage, grid integration, and cost competitiveness.”*

#### **ChatGPT Output:**

> Renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower reduce reliance on fossil fuels and cut carbon emissions. They are eco-friendly and sustainable but face challenges of storage, grid integration, and costs.
> **Result:** ✅ Clear | Balanced | **Score: 5/5**

#### **Claude Output:**

> Solar, wind, and hydropower are growing as sustainable energy options that lower fossil fuel use and emissions. Despite their benefits, challenges with storage, integration, and affordability remain.
> **Result:** ✅ Smooth tone | Professional | **Score: 4.5/5**

#### **Bard/Gemini Output:**
